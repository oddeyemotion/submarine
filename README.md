# submarine

"Submarine" is a hybrid 4WD, Bluetooth-controlled competitive robot car. It is capable of collecting and holding solid game pieces of varying profile while moving across the playing field with desired accuracy and excessively high speed.

Our robot was constructed in a 7-week period regarding M.E.R.C 2023 tournament. In the end we were eliminated from the competition in the quarterfinals, but we gained a lot of new experiences, insights, and connections, and this was honestly an invaluable experience.

Team Submarine: An Thien Dinh (Samuel/Sam), Tan Ngoc Doan, Bao Quang Vo, Huy Quang Nguyen, Hang Thi-Thuy Le (Arris, Team captain).
