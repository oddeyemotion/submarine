### DIY 12-roller omni wheel
STL files for 3D printing can be located in ***DIY 12-roller omni wheel*** folder, or you can also visit [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6040100).

This wheel design is part of a robot car project I made with some friends for a school competition, perfectly compatible with common 12mm hex wheel adapter.

More details about the development of this design at

I used the original design as a guide to redraw it with the same diameter as my tractor wheels, which are approximately 66-67mm in diameter. I replaced the paper clips, which are about 1mm in diameter, with a bunch of 2mm steel rods that were cut to 25-27mm in length.

Our printer has an error margin of about 0.4mm.

It is recommended to use 3 layers of heat shrink tubing for each roller's coverage.

Order of assembly: Top half 1 - Top half 2 - Middle plus - Middle - Bottom half 2 - Bottom half 1
(I am sorry for the confusion T__T)

Secured with:

6x regular 8mm M3 bolts layered with 3x female M3 brass hex standoff pillar rod spacer in the middle
12x regular pairs of 12mm M2 bolts and nuts (recommended 10mm in length for better fit)
